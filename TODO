Data.ByteString.Lex.Integral:
    * See how many of the new specializations ({Int,Word}{8,16,32,64}) are actually useful in practice.
    * relax the Integral constraint to Num wherever possible?

./test/:
	* set up testing in Cabal; necessary for TravisCI to do anything interesting

./bench/html/:
    * Update the css to match the changes elsewhere
	* set up benchmarking in Cabal

Data.ByteString.Lex.Lazy.*:
    * reintroduce modules for working with lazy bytestrings

.travis.yml:
    * get this to actually work...
