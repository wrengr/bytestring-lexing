=== Haskell bytestring-lexing package AUTHORS/THANKS file ===

The bytestring-lexing package was originally written by Don Stewart
and released under the terms in the LICENSE file. In January 2012
maintainership was taken over by wren gayle romano. I would also
like to give thanks to the following contributers:

Bryan O'Sullivan --- For adding support for parsing Doubles from
    lazy bytestrings back during Don's maintainership. Also for
    inspiring the improved (v0.4.2) packDecimal implementation.

Erik de Castro Lopo, Vincent Hanquez, and Christoph Breitkopf ---
    for excessive tweaking and benchmarking of the readDecimal
    function.
